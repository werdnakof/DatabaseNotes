### Synchronous vs Asynchronous protocols
**HTTP** is a synchronous protocol: request from client to server is followed by server-to-client in the same instance of TCP connection

**SMTP** is an synchronous protocol: email messages are sent on a store-and-forward basis, clients need not to be active when receiving messages.
