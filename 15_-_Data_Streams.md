# Data Streams
Traditional DBMS
- persistet data storage
- relatively static records
- (typically) no predefined notion of time
- complex one-off queries

Some applications might require:
- data arrives at real time
- ordering of data
- too much data to store and persist
- data never stops coming
- ongoing analysis of rapidly changeing data

There are also two types of d:
- **_Transactional_** data streams: logs of entities interactions.
- **_Measurement_** data streams: monitoring evolution of entity states
