# Logging and Recovery
Consider a **disk**, a **buffer**, and a **in-memory transaction**

and operations:
- write(x) - write from memory to buffer
- read(x) - read from buffer to memory, or from disk if not present in buffer
- output(x) - write to disk from buffer 
- input(x) - write to buffer from disk

| Action  |  X  |  Y  |$X_b$|$Y_b$|$X_d$|$Y_d$| Log |
|:-------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|         |     |     |     |     |20   |50   |     |
| read(x) |  20 |     |20   |     |20   |50   |     |
| x=x-10  |  10 |     |20   |     |20   |50   |     |
|write(x) |  10 |     |10   |     |20   |50   |     |
| read(y) |  10 | 50  |10   | 50  |20   |50   |     |
| y=y+10  |  10 | 60  |10   | 50  |20   |50   |     |
|write(y) |  10 | 60  |10   | 60  |20   |50   |     |
|output(x)|  10 | 60  |10   | 60  |10   |50   |     |
|output(y)|  10 | 60  |10   | 60  |10   |60   |     |

### Logging
main approach to recovering from a system crash relies on a persistent record of changes made during a transaction

3 ways:
- undo logging
- redo logging
- undo/redo logging
log records:
- **start-T**: transaction T has started execution
- **commit-T**: transaction T has completed successfully and will make not further changes to database items
- **abort-T**: transaction T could not complete successfully, no changes made by T will be copied to disk

### Undo Logging Rules
1. If transaction T modifies database item X, then a log record of the form <T, X, old-value> must be written to disk **before** the new value of X is written to disk
2. If a transaction T commits, then its \<commit-T\> log record must be written to disk only after all database items changed by T have been written to disk

| Action  |  X  |  Y  |$X_b$|$Y_b$|$X_d$|$Y_d$| Log |
|:-------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|         |     |     |     |     |20   |50   |\<start-T\>|
| read(x) |  20 |     |20   |     |20   |50   |     |
| x=x-10  |  10 |     |20   |     |20   |50   |     |
|write(x) |  10 |     |10   |     |20   |50   |\<T, X, 20\>|
| read(y) |  10 | 50  |10   | 50  |20   |50   |     |
| y=y+10  |  10 | 60  |10   | 50  |20   |50   |     |
|write(y) |  10 | 60  |10   | 60  |20   |50   |\<T, Y, 50\>|
|flush log|
|output(x)|  10 | 60  |10   | 60  |10   |50   |     |
|output(y)|  10 | 60  |10   | 60  |10   |60   |     |
|         |     |     |     |     |     |     |\<commit-T\>|
|flush log|

### Recovery with Undo Logging

		for each log entry <T, X, old>, scanning backwards {
			if <commit T> has been seen {
				do nothing
			} else {
				change the value of X in the database back to old
			}
		}
		for each incomplete transaction T (that was not borted) {
			write <abort T> to log
		}
		flush log

### Checkpointing with Undo Logging
Disadvantage of this approach: we must scan the entire log.
Introduce a periodic checkpoint in the log
- Before checkpoint, all transactions have committed or aborted
- Only need search backwards through the log to the most recent checkpoint

New log record type:
\<ckpt>: The database has been checkpointed

Checkpointing
1. Stop accepting new transactions
2. Wait until all active transactions commit/abort and write <commit T>/<abort T> to the log
3. flush log
4. write <ckpt> to log
5. flush log
6. Resume accepting transactions

### Nonquiescent Checkpointing
- Need to stop transaction processing while checkpointing (method above)
- System may appear to stall
- Allow new transactions to enter the system during the checkpoint.

New log record types:
- \<start ckpt (T1...Tn)> (Checkpoint starts. T1...Tn are active transactions that
have not yet committed)
- \<end ckpt>

1. Write \<start ckpt (T1...Tn)> to log and flush log
2. Wait until T1..Tn have all committed or aborted
3. Write <end ckpt> to log and flush log
